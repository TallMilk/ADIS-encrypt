this is a simplistic and quick, yet interesting, implementation of an iterative image type used
as a key device for encryption. simply shows how it works and provides a (very) simple GUI to use it
feel free to do with as you wish; i highly doubt it could be used in this unrefined state, but with improvements it could definitely be a strong encryption system.
